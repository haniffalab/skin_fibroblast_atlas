# Skin fibroblast atlas

Skin fibroblast subtypes are uncertain, and different studies typically use distinct nomenclature. We performed the largest integration of scRNA-seq data for skin fibroblasts, combined with single-cell resolution spatial transcriptomics, to decode fibroblast heterogeneity.

"Integration" contains scripts used for integration\
"Figures" contains scripts for producing figures \

Data (scRNA and Xenium) can be visualized and downloaded here (currently password protected (password in manuscript under submission)): https://app.cellatlas.io/skin-fibroblast/ https://collections.cellatlas.io/skin-fibroblast (
